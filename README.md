This tool empowers translators and reviewers to go beyond the standard Transifex reports. All data is stored securely in your browser's `localStorage`, ensuring complete privacy and control. No servers, no sign-ups, no tracking.

I made this (with help from AI) at first for myself. But then I thought, why not share it with everyone as open source? So I decided to share it.
